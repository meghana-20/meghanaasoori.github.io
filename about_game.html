      <h2>Snake and Ladder Game Rules and Player Limitations</h2>
      <p><b>Objective:</b> The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach the final square, which is usually marked as square 100.</p>
      <p><b>Players:</b>The game supports a maximum of four players. Players can choose the number of participants from 2 to 4.</p>
      <p><b>Gameplay:</b><br>

        Players take turns to roll a six-sided die and move forward the number of squares indicated by the die roll.<br>
        If a player lands on a square at the bottom of a ladder, they will climb to the square at the top of the ladder.<br>
        If a player lands on a square with the head of a snake, they will slide down to the square at the tail of the snake.<br>
        The game continues until one player reaches the final square (100).</p>
        <p><b>Winning:</b><br>

          The first player to land exactly on square 100 is declared the winner.<br>
          If a player's move would take them beyond square 100, they must wait until their next turn to try again.<br>
          The game ends immediately once a player reaches square 100.</p>
